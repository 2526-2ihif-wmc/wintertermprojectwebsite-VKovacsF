                <h2>ABOUT THE ALBUM</h2>
                <p>
                    Zuu (stylized in all caps) is the fourth studio album of Denzel Curry, released through PH Recordings and Loma Vista on May 31, 2019. The title is a nickname for his home city, Carol City, Florida.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Zuu is the follow-up to Curry's 2018 studio album Ta13oo. It was supported by two singles: "Ricky" and "Speedboat". The album received widespread acclaim from critics, with many praising Curry's tributes to other artists from Carol City.

                <h2>PRODUCTION & THEME</h2>
                <p>
                    The album features guest appearances by Kiddo Marv, Rick Ross, Tay Keith, Ice Billion Berg, Sam Sneak, and PlayThatBoiZay. Production was primarily handled by FnZ, alongside Tay Keith himself, Charlie Heat, Ronny J, and others.

                <p>
                    Denzel Curry said that while his previous album Ta13oo (2018) was rooted in darker themes, Zuu came from homesickness for Miami.

                <p>
                    Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic saying <b>"In less than a half hour, Curry establishes himself not only as one of the most capable and exciting artists of his generation, but also worthy of a place in Miami's rap pedigree, right alongside the local icons who inspired this gem"</b>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Danny Schwartz of Highsnobiety said, <b>"If TA1300 was a deep inward dive, ZUU is a mighty outward gesture, a salute to the masses"</b>.
