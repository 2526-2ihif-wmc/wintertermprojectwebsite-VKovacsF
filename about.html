                <h2>Who</h2>
                <p>
                    This website was made by Vince K.F., second-year student of HTL Leonding.

                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    Among my various musical taste, hiphop is among the categories I most frequently listen to. I have first stumbled upon Denzel Curry's music a couple of years ago, specifically his <span>ZUU</span> album's BIRDZ. I enjoyed the raw, arrogant style and decided to listen to the full album, before exploring his whole discography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was very satisfied with the variety Denzel's albums provided, from the melancholic beats of Ta13oo discussing personal history, political events and the declining state of the US, to the retrospective rap talking speaking about life experience, to the mixtape style janky beats.
                </p>

                <h4>Fun fact:</h4>

                <p>
                    Most likely all of you have at least heard ONE Denzel Curry song. One of his old mixtape tracks became very popular through meme culture. <a class="flip" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR24Pfw7Ykw&t=11s">Bottle Flip</a>
